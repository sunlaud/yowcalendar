## Prerequisites
- Java 8 JDK with JavaFX (JavaFX is bundled with Oracle JDK 8 and should be installed as a separate installable package (OpenJFX) for OpenJDK)

## Usage

## TODO

- configuration instead of hardcoded config values
- externalize holidays config (at least a warning about outdated holidays)
- decompose and cleanup God class
- editing of css when launched from jar
- localization
